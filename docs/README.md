# arr.ai docs

This directory contains the arr.ai docs as a Docusaurus website.

The old README that used to be here is now at https://arrai.netlify.app/docs/lang/intro.

## Usage

If this is the first time you're building the docs, start with:

```bash
yarn install
```

To run a local Docusaurus server:

```bash
yarn start
```

The site will be served on http://localhost:3000.
