title: Grammar

The grammar specifies which sequences of characters are valid arr.ai programs and which are not. Adding new syntax to arr.ai requires a change to the grammar (but don't forget that [macros](../lang/macros.md) may be able to solve your problem more easily).

The arr.ai grammar is defined using [Ï‰BNF](https://github.com/arr-ai/wbnf) in [arrai.wbnf](https://github.com/arr-ai/arrai/blob/master/syntax/arrai.wbnf).
