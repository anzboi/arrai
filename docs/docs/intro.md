## What is arr.ai?

[Sysl](https://github.com/anz-bank/sysl) is an open-sourced system specification language designed for modelling distributed web applications. A Sysl specification captures the design of your project—or your entire organisation—and becomes a single source of truth.

Sysl supports an ecosystem of tools that generate all kinds of artifacts, including:

- API documentation
- Design diagrams: data, integration and sequence
- SQL scripts: create and migrate databases
- Boilerplate code: client/server REST/gRPC in Go

Sysl saves time, allows you to focus on your core business logic, and guarantees that the design and implementation stay in sync.

## Get started

Check out [Installation](./install) for how to install arr.ai. Or just grab a pre-compiled binary from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/arr-ai/arrai/releases).

To write arr.ai code, you'll want [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [vscode-arrai extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arr-ai.vscode-arrai) for syntax highlighting `.arrai` files.
